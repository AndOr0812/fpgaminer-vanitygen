These modules are currently only designed with vanity mining in mind.
They are a serial design (no pipelining), and not particularly efficient.


WARNING: Do not use these modules for applications that require accurate results. These modules may rarely make mistakes. This is intentional, as a compromise for increased performance. The errors have no significance when searching for vanity addresses, as all results are verified by external software.

Beyond that, the code has not been thoroughly audited for accuracy and cryptographic security (resistance to side channel attacks).
